# Chatbot Experiments

A beginner-friendly project where I’m learning to build chatbots using different approaches: rule-based, machine learning, and AI. This is a work in progress as I explore Python, NLP, and AI tools. Feedback welcome!

## Project Overview

This repo contains my experiments with three chatbot types:
- **Rule-Based**: Matches user inputs to predefined patterns using NLTK.
- **ML-Based**: Uses TF-IDF and SVM from Scikit-learn to predict intents.
- **AI-Based**: Generates responses with DialoGPT from Transformers.

## Files

- `rule_based_chatbot.py`: Simple chatbot matching text to intents.
- `ml_chatbot.py`: ML chatbot with SVM for intent classification.
- `ai_chatbot.py`: AI chatbot using DialoGPT for generative replies.
- `notebook.ipynb`: My original Jupyter Notebook with all experiments.(willadd)

## Requirements:

-nltk
-scikit-learn
-transformers
-torch
-tqdm 

## Status
I’m a beginner learning NLP and AI. This project is incomplete but growing as I add more features, intents, and polish. Suggestions are appreciated!

What I’ve Learned
Basic text preprocessing with NLTK.
Training ML models with Scikit-learn.
Using pre-trained AI models with Transformers.


## Next Steps
Add more intents for better conversations.
Improve AI responses with tuning.
Create a simple UI (maybe with Streamlit).
Thanks
Thanks for checking out my work!
